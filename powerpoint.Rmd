## Software Security Testing Introduction

- Determines that software protects data and maintains security specifications as given
- Uncovers vulnerabilities of the system and determines that the data and resources of the system are well-protected
- Ensuring that the software system and application are free from any threats or risks that can cause a loss
- To understand and implement good test plans for security testing we must understand what is software quality, software development framework (SDLC) software testing life-cycle (STLC), software requirements, and major issues that cause security breaches.

## Security-related bugs vs.traditional bugs

- Security-related bugs can differ from traditional bugs in several ways
- Security testing is often fundamentally different from traditional testing because it emphasizes what an application should not do rather than what it should do [9]
- Malicious attackers do intelligently search for vulnerabilities. If they succeed, they cause problems for other users, who may be adversely affected. Compounding the problem, malicious hackers are known to script successful attacks and distribute them.[9]
- Since most developers are not currently trained in secure programming practices, security analysts carry a greater burden in verifying that secure programming practices are adhered to.[9]
- Many security requirements can be neither refined nor dropped even if they are un-testable. e.g.  ”an attacker should never be able to take control of the application,” would be regarded as un-testable in a traditional software development setting [9]

## Software Security Testing in related with Software Development Life Cycle

- The result is that secure software development is intrinsically harder than traditional software development. Therefore, testing also has an expanded role. Software testing also has other strengths that can be leveraged during secure software development
- Testing can help confirm that the developers did not overlook some insecure programming practices.
- A vulnerability is usually taken more seriously if there is a known exploit for it, but developing exploits is the domain of penetration testing
- Testing can be used to help identify and mitigate risks from third-party components, where development artifacts like source code and architecture diagrams are unavailable.
- Testing can be used to provide metrics of software insecurity and help raise the alarm when software is seriously flawed from a security standpoint.
- Every design artifact views the software system at a certain level of abstraction. Attackers like to find the abstractions used by developers and work their way around them. No person or group can view a software system at all possible levels of abstraction, but testing can help by perhaps finding (at least some) flaws that are not visible in the design artifacts.[9]
- It is often said that security testing is only a small part of secure programming [10]. It is very difficult to find all security-related problems in a software system. Thus, no effective mitigation strategy should be overlooked.

## Software Security Testing Goal

- To identify the threats in the system.
- To measure the potential vulnerabilities of the system.
- To help in detecting every possible security risk in the system.
- To help developers in fixing the security problems through coding.

## Software Security Testing Principle:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Availability
- Non-repudiation

## Test Case Designing for Security Testing:

- Test if users can directly access bookmarked web pages without login.
- Test if the system restricts users to download the file without logging in.
- Test if previously accessed pages should not be accessible after log out (i.e. Sign out and then press the Back button to access the page accessed before).
- Test if the industry standard username & password rules are enforced.
- Test if sensitive information (passwords, ID numbers, credit card numbers, etc.) is stored as plain text. They should be encrypted and in Asterix format.
- Test if bookmarking is disabled on secure pages by default.
- Test if source code is invisible to users.
- Test if older version web browsers can access the app (older version web browsers do not support SSL).
- Test if multiple attempts are being blocked.
- Test if the system completely logs out the current user after time out.
- Test if the user’s connection is stable and secure.
- Verify that relevant information (upload, download, activities) are written to the log files and that information should be traceable.
- Test if the SSL encryption is done correctly and verifies the integrity of the information.
- Prevent the same username to log in at the same time.
- Check if important credentials are updated immediately.
- Test if error messages don’t contain important information.

## Types of Security Testing

- Vulnerability Scanning: 
  - performs with the help of automated software to scan a system to detect the known vulnerability patterns.
- Security Scanning: 
  - Is the identification of network and system weaknesses.
  - Providing solutions for reducing these defects or risks. 
  - Can be carried out in both manual and automated ways. 
- Penetration Testing: 
  - is the simulation of the attack from a malicious hacker. 
  - Including an analysis of a particular system to examine for potential vulnerabilities from a malicious hacker that attempts to hack the system.
- Risk Assessment: 
  - testing security risks observed in the organization are analyzed. 
  - Risks are classified into three categories (low, medium, and high). 
  - This testing endorses controls and measures to minimize the risk.
- Security Auditing: 
  - is an internal inspection of applications and operating systems for security defects. 
  - An audit can also be carried out via line-by-line checking of code. 
- Ethical Hacking: Ethical hacking is different from malicious hacking. Ethical hacking aims to expose security flaws in the organization’s system. 
- Posture Assessment: It combines security scanning, ethical hacking, and risk assessments to provide an overall security posture of an organization.

## Use case of Pen Testing:

Simulate Man-In-The_Middle Attack on a system. Pre-requirements knowledge:

- Python Scapy Package: 
  - Scapy is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program and library. 
- Kali Linux: 
  - is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution
  - gear towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics, and Reverse Engineering [11]
  - Pre-installed more than 600 tools
- Cyber Security principles 
- Networking Principles: Understanding of MAC Address, Access Point, various Networking Devices, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Domain Name Server (DNS) 
- Understanding of OSI Model and TCP/IP Model: Understand Layers Architecture of OSI Model and TCP/IP Models, Understand IPV4 and IPV6 - Web Application Structures: (Client-Server Model) 
- Python Programming: String Manipulation, Parsing HTML, Sending & receiving HTTP requests, Netfilterqueue, Socket Programming, Data Structures, OOP

## Tools that is used in Man-In-The_Middle Attack:

- MAC Address Changer
- Network Scanner
- ARP Spoofer (ARP Cache Poisoning)
- Packet Sniffer
- DNS Spoofer (DNS Cache Poisoning)
- File Interceptor

## Senario:

- Demonstrate how to implement a man-in-the-middle-attack on a private network (or a private system that we don’t have permission to get access to). 
- All tools will be written from scratch and source code can be found at [13].
- The benefit of writing our own program is that hackers can automate the whole hacking process, implemented machine learning & artificial intelligence, and provide efficient source code control.
- Private networks usually exist on a physical building with access within that building. 
- Private Networks are considered more secure than public networks, however, they won’t be secure if an adversary gets access to one of the computers in the network. 
- Man-In-The-Middle can be established just by one computer being hacked and spread out to many other devices within the network. 


### A. System under normal operation:

Under normal operation, each client is connected to an access point within the organization (inside its building). Please notice access to the private network only can be granted within access points within the building (wired and wireless)

### B. Hackers Gain Access to The System:

Access can be gained in many ways insider attack, malware backdoor, code Injector, malware package… I will not focus on how the hackers gain access to the system. However, my focus is to simulate the strategy that hackers spread out the virus after gaining access and controlling the system.

Hackers can use remote devices that are set up within the building or gain control of one of the devices within the organization to perform the task. They start with one device then spread the attack to all other devices. Each of the devices gets accessed by the hacker can become bots and send out information, or spread out the virus to other devices within the network. Some viruses can contain themselves, create a backdoor, and pass security scanners by changing their MAC address or IP address. Depending on how many devices hackers want to control, they usually need a supercomputer to handle the task.


The plan of attack is. The entire plan is designed by Truc Huynh, with the idea from [14]:

- Step 1: Get Access to one computer: 
  - Through a USB stick equipped with a custom Linux version.
  - Enable backdoor on user’s computer.

- Step 2: Established Man-In-The-Middle:
  - Redirect the flow of packet by running ‘ARP Spoofer’.
  - ‘ARP Spoofer’ will run ‘Network Scanner’ to get all the IP and Mac addresses on the network.
  - Then store the result, and run ‘Mac Address Changer’ to change our MAC address hacking devices (USB stick or remote computer) to a physical MAC address of a local computer (in the private network).

- Step 3: Gather information
  - Using ‘Packet_Sniffer’ to read the packet and data flow through the hacker interface.
  - Use the information that ‘Packet Sniffer’ collect to create a suitable plan for spreading the virus to another machine within the network.

- Step 4: Modify Data, spread virus
  - Using the plan that creates on step 3 to attack other computers. Depend on security structure on the network using ‘DNS Spoofer’ or ‘File Interceptor’ (or both).
  - Using ‘File Interceptor’ to modify HTTP data that send over HTTP, replace a user’s download request with a completely different file (virus, backdoor…).
  - Using ‘DNS Spoofer’ (modify data in DNS Layer) to redirect the destination on the computer on the network (e.g. to a fake website) so that the hacker can install a backdoor on another local computer.
  - Slowly spread and contain them-self, avoid detection by the network administrator, or any security system on the network.

- Step 5:
  - Decide if the attack is a success or not.
  - Make sure the attack doesn’t create any evidence that leads to the hacker (protocol tracing, IP Address tracing).

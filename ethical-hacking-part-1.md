## Abstract:
- The paper introduce security testing. 
- The paper also discuss about types of security testing.
- A Use case of simulating Man-In-The-Middle Attack on a system, and the tools that can be used in an Man-In-The-Middle Attack (Python, Kali Linux, Web Application)
- Overview of Penetration Testing Methods(Pen Testing) and its related work

## Introduction:
### A. Software Security Testing:
- Security Testing or Software Testing Security determines that software protects data and maintains security specification as given. 
Another word to say: "security testing uncovers vulnerabilities of the system and determines that the data and resources of the system are well protected".
It ensures that the software system and application are free from any threats or risks that can cause a loss.
- To understand and implement good security test plans we must understand what is software quality, software development framework (SDLC)
software testing lifecycle (STLC), and software requirements. 
- We also need to understand major issues that cause security breaches.
- Security testing is often fundamentally different from traditional testing because it emphasizes what an application should not do rather than what it should do, as pointed out in [9],

### A. Security Testing Goal
- To identify the threats in the system.
- To measure the potential vulnerabilities of the system.
- To help in detecting every possible security risk in the system.
- To help developers in fixing the security problems through coding.

### B. Security Testing Principle
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Availability
- Non-repudiation

### C. Major Focus Areas in Security Testing
- Network Security
- System Software Security
- Client-side Application Security
- Server-side Application Security

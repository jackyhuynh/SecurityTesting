## Problem:

## Solution:


Tools are used in Man-In-The_Middle Attack:

- MAC Address Changer
- Network Scanner
- ARP Spoofer (ARP Cache Poisoning)
- Packet Sniffer
- DNS Spoofer (DNS Cache Poisoning)
- File Interceptor

### 1. Enviroment:
- Perform Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack on a virtual private network 
- Etablished by using VM Ware
- Hardware: 
	- PC 64 bits, Intel Core i7 10th Gen, 36 GB of ram
- Software: 
	- Microsoft Window 10 (host)
	- VM Ware Sphere (or free version)
	- Kali Linux (free)
## Results:

## Conclusion/Future work
There are monitoring
